# Fami-ChatGPT #
Fami-ChatGPT is an AI assistant designed specifically for seniors who are not adept at using online resources. This project connects ChatGPT to various popular chat room software and is expected to include family-related features as well as more rigorous data accuracy verification.

The project has some principles:
1. (TODO) `Accurate and truthful information`: The chat content is friendly and unbiased, and all information must be completely accurate.
2. `Encryption`: The GPT-Bot has the ability for continuous conversation and all chat content is encrypted and runs in volatile memory during service execution.
3. (TODO) `Memory conversation`: The chat service has a note-taking function that uses natural language processing to recall previously mentioned content.
4. (TODO) `Real-time search AI`: The service provides real-time online search and responds smoothly based on the search results through GPT.
